# Integrating an app with lode

**English** · [中文](integration.zh-CN.md)

Integration spans three files, each with one owner:

| File | Where | Who writes it | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`lode.toml`** | local | the operator | how lode fetches & runs your app |
| **`state.json`** | local (`$DATA_DIR`) | lode **and** the app | runtime comms (status ↔ requests) |
| **release feed** | remote | the publisher | the signed asset listing — a native `manifest.json` **or** GitHub Releases |

The three steps below — **configure → run → publish** — are the whole integration. The
operator names the exact asset to install (`[update].asset`); that filename is the
selection key for both sources. For the full signing spec see
[source-adapters.md](source-adapters.md); for exhaustive field listings see
[`lode.example.toml`](lode.example.toml) and [`manifest.example.json`](manifest.example.json);
the deep design is in [architecture](architecture.md).

---

## 1. Configure lode (`lode.toml`)

The operator's file: *how to fetch and run your app*. The app never writes it.
Precedence is `CLI > env (LODE_*) > lode.toml > defaults`; by default lode reads
`/srv/lode/lode.toml` (override the base dir with `LODE_DATA_DIR`) and scaffolds a
starter there on first run.

```toml
[global]
app      = "myapp"          # must match the manifest "name"
data_dir = "/srv/lode"      # holds lode.toml + versions/ + state.json + lode.pid + runtime/

[update]
github   = "owner/myapp"                                        # GitHub Releases …
# manifest = "https://releases.example.com/myapp/manifest.json" # … OR a native manifest (pick one)
asset    = "myapp-linux-x64.tar.gz"   # the asset filename for THIS host (the selection key)
channel  = "stable"         # github: stable=/releases/latest, else newest prerelease ; native: channel key
policy   = "auto"           # off | check | auto
# pin    = "1.4.2"          # lock a version (disables auto-update)

[trust]
require_signature = "enforce"                       # off | auto | enforce
trusted_keys = ["<key_id>:<base64-pubkey>"]         # from `lode-cli keygen`

[command]
run     = "./myapp"         # literal command to launch the app (cwd = version dir; a manifest asset may override)
exec    = "./myapp"         # literal base for `lode <args>` passthrough
# workdir = "{dir}"         # optional; omit for the version dir (default). Set an absolute path to run elsewhere (e.g. for .env discovery)

[supervise]
readiness    = "state"      # none | state (commit a version only after the app reports ready)
health_grace = 15           # seconds a new version must survive to be "good" (else rollback)
stop_timeout = 10           # graceful-stop window before SIGKILL
restart      = "on-failure" # on-failure (default, keep-alive: retry then pause) | always | off (mirror child)
```

Common shapes:

- **Self-contained binary:** `run = "./myapp serve"`, `exec = "./myapp"` (or omit `[command]` and publish `run`/`exec` in the manifest asset instead).
- **Script under a runtime:** `run = "bun run"`, `exec = "bun"`, plus a `[runtime]` block to fetch `bun` if it's not on PATH — cached for reuse, optionally version-pinned (`version`); note a runtime download is **not** signature-verified.
- **Private source:** add `[http].headers = ["Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}"]` — sent on manifest + artifact fetches, with `${ENV}` expansion.

See [`lode.example.toml`](lode.example.toml) for every option and `[runtime]`/`[signals]`/`restart_*`.

---

## 2. The app contract (`state.json`)

What *your app* implements. Any language — read/write one JSON file and handle `SIGTERM`.

**Environment lode injects:** `LODE_ACTIVE_VERSION` (current version), `LODE_DATA_DIR`
(`state.json` lives at `$LODE_DATA_DIR/state.json`), `LODE_INSTANCE` (unique id for this
launch — write it to `state.ready`). The host env (e.g. `PORT`) passes through; internal
`LODE_*` are stripped. The operator can add more via the `[env]` table — those are
**defaults**: an inherited host env var of the same name (e.g. a per-deploy `-e PORT`)
wins over them, and lode's three vars above always win over everything.

**state.json** — lode writes status, the app writes requests; the field sets don't overlap:

```jsonc
{
  // lode writes (app reads):
  "current": "1.4.2", "last_good": "1.4.2", "available": "1.5.0",
  "status": "running",        // starting|running|updating|rolling-back|stopping|stopped|error
  "pid": 12345, "last_check": "…", "last_error": null,
  // app writes (requests / readiness):
  "target": null,             // a version or "latest" => request up/down-grade
  "restart_nonce": 0,          // increment => restart the current version
  "ready": null               // set to LODE_INSTANCE => "I can serve now"
}
```

Implement these (all but `SIGTERM` are optional, but recommended):

- **Graceful stop (required):** on `SIGTERM`, drain and `exit(0)` within `stop_timeout`, or you're `SIGKILL`ed. lode sets `status = updating|stopping` first so you can distinguish.
  ```ts
  process.on("SIGTERM", async () => { await drain(); process.exit(0) })
  ```
- **Readiness (if `readiness = "state"`):** after you can actually serve, atomically write `state.ready = LODE_INSTANCE` (temp-file + rename, preserving lode's fields). lode won't commit the version (or stop the old instance, in zero-downtime modes) until then; missing it past `ready_timeout` → rollback.
  - **Phased prepare handshake (opt-in):** report serving with `state.ready = "{LODE_INSTANCE}-0"` instead of the bare token. On an update lode writes `state.ready = "{LODE_INSTANCE}-1"` to prompt you to prepare; drain/checkpoint, then ack with `"{LODE_INSTANCE}-2"` and the cut-over begins. The cut-over is app-paced by default (`prepare_timeout = 0`); a non-zero `[supervise].prepare_timeout` (seconds) forces it if you never ack. Mechanism details in [architecture](architecture.md) §8.
- **Health:** `exit(non-zero)` on startup failure. A version that exits within `health_grace` is rolled back to the last good one (single-strike).
- **Self-report version** (e.g. `GET /version`) matching `LODE_ACTIVE_VERSION`.
- **Request an update/restart (optional):** atomically patch `state.json` — set `target` (a version or `"latest"`) or bump `restart_nonce`. lode polls the file's mtime (~1s) and acts; the file *is* the notification.

### Concurrent writes — the `state.json.lock` contract

`state.json` has two writers (lode and your app), and a read-modify-write —
read, patch your fields, write back — can silently lose the other side's
concurrent update. lode serialises **all of its own RMWs** with an exclusive
`flock(2)` on the sibling file `$LODE_DATA_DIR/state.json.lock` (created on
demand, never deleted; the lock lives on a sibling because `state.json` itself
is replaced by temp-file + rename on every write).

- **Apps doing RMW SHOULD take the same lock:** open `state.json.lock`
  (create if absent), `flock(fd, LOCK_EX)` (blocks only microseconds), then
  read `state.json` → patch your fields → write atomically (temp + rename) →
  unlock (closing the fd releases it). Hold the lock for the whole cycle and
  nothing more.
- **Plain reads need no lock:** the temp + rename replacement is atomic, so
  any read of `state.json` always sees a complete, consistent snapshot.

## 3. Publish the release feed

lode resolves a **channel → version → asset**, verifies it, and installs/runs it.
The asset each host installs is chosen by **filename** (`[update].asset`), and every
asset carries an ed25519 signature over the canonical message
`lode.artifact.v1\n{name}\n{version}\n{sha256}\n{run}\n{exec}` (UTF-8, `\n`-separated, no trailing
newline; `run`/`exec` are empty string when absent). `name` is the asset filename. Full spec, including the native manifest
shape and field tables: [source-adapters.md](source-adapters.md).

Packaging + signing are the **publisher's** job, doable in any CI. `lode-cli` is a
reference implementation; any ed25519 tooling that produces the same signature works.

### Keys (once)

`lode-cli keygen` prints `key_id`, the `trusted_keys` entry (`<key_id>:<base64>`,
hand to operators), and the secret seed — keep it offline.

### GitHub Releases (`github = "owner/repo"`)

Drop this workflow into **your app's** repo. It builds your assets and — **only if a
signing key is configured** — signs each one and uploads the signature as the asset
`label`. With no key it uploads unsigned, so it works before you adopt signing.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/release.yml — publish your app's assets for lode
on:
  release:
    types: [published]      # cut the release (UI or `gh release create`); this attaches assets
permissions:
  contents: write
jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      GH_TOKEN: ${{ github.token }}
      TAG: ${{ github.event.release.tag_name }}
      LODE_SIGNING_KEY: ${{ secrets.LODE_SIGNING_KEY }}   # optional — set it to enable signing
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Build assets                # -> dist/<app>-<os>-<arch>.<ext>   (you supply this)
        run: ./build.sh "$TAG"

      - name: Publish (sign only if a key is set)
        run: |
          set -euo pipefail
          if [ -n "${LODE_SIGNING_KEY:-}" ]; then
            curl -fsSL https://github.com/dotns/lode/releases/latest/download/lode-linux-x64.tar.gz \
              | tar -xz lode lode-cli                 # fetch lode-cli to sign with
          fi
          for f in dist/*; do
            if [ -n "${LODE_SIGNING_KEY:-}" ]; then
              sig=$(./lode-cli sign "$f" --version "$TAG" --key-env LODE_SIGNING_KEY)
              gh release upload "$TAG" "$f#$sig" --clobber     # label = signature
            else
              gh release upload "$TAG" "$f" --clobber          # unsigned
            fi
          done
```

- **Enable signing:** run `lode-cli keygen` once; put the secret seed in the repo's
  `LODE_SIGNING_KEY` secret (keep a copy offline), and give operators the public
  `trusted_keys` entry. No secret set → assets upload unsigned (fine until you adopt it;
  the sign branch never runs).
- lode picks the asset whose `name` equals the operator's `[update].asset`; `sha256`
  comes from the asset `digest` (re-verified against the bytes), `version` from the tag.
  `channel = stable` → `/releases/latest`; other channels → newest non-draft prerelease;
  `pin` → a specific tag. No `manifest.json` asset is needed. Private repo: token in
  `[http].headers`.
- Name assets `<app>-<os>-<arch>.<ext>`; each operator sets `[update].asset` to the exact
  filename for their host.

### Native manifest (`manifest = "https://.../manifest.json"`)

Host a `lode/v1` manifest whose per-version `assets[]` are keyed by `name`, plus the
assets at any HTTPS URLs:

```bash
lode-cli manifest "$f" --version 1.5.0 --url "$URL" \
    --run ./myapp --exec ./myapp \
    --key private.key --into manifest.json   # upserts the asset by name, sets channels.latest; --run/--exec are optional
lode-cli manifest-sign --into manifest.json --key private.key   # optional: tamper-evidence over the catalog
```

Manifest shape + the per-asset field table live in
[source-adapters.md §6](source-adapters.md). `manifest-sign` is **optional**
(verify-if-present tamper-evidence); `channels.<c>.latest` rollback is caught
client-side by the downgrade floor, and a `pin` removes trust in the pointer
entirely.

### Signing model (both sources)

- The artifact signature binds **`name` (filename) / `version` / `sha256` / `run` / `exec`**. `format` is derived from the filename extension (`.tar.gz`/`.tgz` → tar.gz, `.gz` → gz, `.zip` → zip, else raw). `run`/`exec` are bound into the signature when present (empty string otherwise) — a tampered catalog cannot inject malicious launch commands under `require_signature = auto` (with keys) or `enforce`.
- Under `require_signature = enforce`, every installed asset must carry a valid
  signature (github: the `label`; native: the `sig` field or a `.sig` sidecar).
  `auto` is fail-closed once any trusted key is configured; without keys it installs
  **UNVERIFIED** with a warning.

### Checklist

- [ ] each host's `[update].asset` names the exact asset filename for its platform.
- [ ] `sha256` is of the raw file; `sig` is over `name/version/sha256` with a trusted `key_id`.
- [ ] github: signature set as the asset **`label`**. native: `sig` inline or a `.sig` sidecar, and the catalog re-signed (`manifest-sign`) after the final edit.
- [ ] `channels.<c>.latest` points at a real version (native), or tag/latest resolves (github).
- [ ] private key offline; operators hold only the public `trusted_keys` with `require_signature = enforce`.
